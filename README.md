# Little application where users can create yours post and comment on each...
Or simpler it is just a Blog 🙃

## To run app
If you use pipenv `pipenv shell`
If you don't just type `python manage.py runserver`

## Why am I angry!? 😡
I don't like Python at all! I am a JSboy and that is all explanation, but during creating this app I started hate Python even more
then it was, especially Django, but I know a lot of people like Django and Python, here is a third BUT! I am JSboy remember? 😏
So, that is why Django for me is a bit useless, because I can do better if I use JS! 😎

## Thanks for understanding! 😚
